The above is an example geometry.cfg file. This file is mandatory
on Linux, optional on Windows.
geometry.cfg allows you to answer all of the "loading" queries that
FSOPhantom would otherwise ask upon loading.  
The first line specifies the name of the output file.  
The second line specifies how many STLs will be loaded.  
The third line specifies the XYZ offset to apply to the STLs, if any
Next follows pairs of filepaths to an STL, then the associated 
material definition file for that STL.  
Then comes the XYZ multipliers for the size of the bounding box 
that will surround the models, where 1 1 1 will be the smallest 
parallelipiped that fully contain the model, 10 10 10 would be 10 
times bigger than the minimum on each axis, etc.
Finally comes the filepath the material definition file for the
surrounding volume.
